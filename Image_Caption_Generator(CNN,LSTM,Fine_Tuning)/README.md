# Image Caption Generator (CNN + LSTM with Fine-Tuning)
Overview
This project implements an Image Caption Generator using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model extracts visual features from images using a pretrained VGG16 model and generates meaningful captions using an LSTM-based sequence model.

Project Features
✅ Uses VGG16 (with fine-tuning) for feature extraction
✅ LSTM for generating captions based on image features
✅ Fine-tuned CNN model for better performance
✅ Uses preprocessed image-text dataset for training
✅ Implemented in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

Technologies & Libraries Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
VGG16 (Pretrained CNN Model)
LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
NLTK & Tokenization
Dataset
This project requires an image-caption dataset, such as:
📌 Flickr8k (processed for caption generation)

Model Architecture
1️⃣ CNN (VGG16) extracts features from images.
2️⃣ Feature vectors are passed to the LSTM model.
3️⃣ LSTM generates captions based on extracted features.
4️⃣ Fine-tuning is applied for better accuracy.

Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib nltk
2️⃣ Run the Notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook and run Image_Caption_Generator(CNN,LSTM,Fine_Tuning).ipynb

Results & Performance
📈 The fine-tuned CNN-LSTM model generates meaningful captions for images and improves accuracy by leveraging pretrained VGG16.

Future Improvements
🔹 Use transformer models (e.g., ViT + GPT) for better performance
🔹 Train on larger datasets (MS COCO, Conceptual Captions)
🔹 Implement Beam Search for improved caption generation
